# Netflix-Project
A responsive Netflix homepage using only HTML and CSS. The page focuses on layout, structure, navigation bar design, movie sections, FAQ's and visual styling without using JavaScript. This project shows my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS layouts, flexbox/grid, and clean UI design.
